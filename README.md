PURPOSE AND EXPLANATION OF APP: 
The objective was to create a native Android app using Kotlin. The objective was to create an app that not only provides the average temperature for the week but also allows users to view detailed information for each day. To create this app, Android Studio was used. Started with an empty view activity. The first step completed was the layout of the application. First, the background was created then the button, and text design. After that, each widget was declared using the design, coded each button, and created strings for each widget to optimize the app’s performance. The second and third page was created and declared in Android manifest file. Testing was done on the emulator as well as using GitHub and GitHub actions for automated testing and to ensure a maintainable application


PLANNING PSEUDOCODE: 
Start
 	Declarations 
		string DAY
		num min
		num max
		string weatherConditions
		AVERAGE

ouput “insert the day”
input DAY
output “insert the minimum temperature” 
input min
output “insert the maximum temperature” 
input max
ouput “insert the weather conditions”
input weatherConditions
if min AND max >0 then
	AVERAGE= min + max /2
	Output AVERAGE
